## Features

- **Water Level Monitoring**: The system provides real-time monitoring of the water levels in the tank.
- **Automated Pump Control**: The system automatically controls the pump based on the water levels in the tank, eliminating any chances of water.
- **Flow Rate Monitoring**: The system also provides real-time monitoring of the flow rate of water.(Currently a limited implementation)
- **User-friendly Interface**: The system is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use.
- **Low-cost**: The system is designed to be low-cost and affordable.
- **Sustainable**: The system is built on the principles of sustainability and aims to contribute to the sustainable development goals.

## Hardware Components

- **R3CH340 Microcontroller (Arduino Nano)**: Used for controlling the system.
- **HC-SR04-Ultrasonic Sensor**: Used for water level monitoring.
- **IC-555 Timer**: Used for controlling the pump.
- **12V Relay**: Used for controlling the pump.
- **YFS201 Flow Sensor**: Used for monitoring the flow rate.
- **433Mhz RF Transmitter & Receiver**: Used for real-time monitoring.
- **16x2 LCD Display**: Used for displaying the water levels and alerts.
